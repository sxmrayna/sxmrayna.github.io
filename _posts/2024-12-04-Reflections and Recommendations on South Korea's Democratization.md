In the past one and half months, I've delved into South Korea's democratization history through movies and books (some recommendations are listed below), and made me feel reflective on democratization in East Asia. Coincidentally, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law late last night, and ultimately the National Assembly voting to lift the martial law. 

After reading the details about this news, I was touched that Seoul citizens gathered in front of the National Assembly and fighted against the military. The struggles of the past came at an irreversible and tragic cost, making the fight to protect democracy all the more precious. Democracy and constitutional rule of law have become so deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness that even personal ambitions can no longer revert the system back to dictatorship. 

I also know that this political system isn't as perfect as communism sounds (like what we Chinese were taught in class), and we have seen its flaws by many examples as well, but its principles enable it to correct. Even when the people occasionally elect a less-than-ideal leader, democratic processes ensure that any misstep can be corrected within a few years. What invaluable is that this system offer people an enduring sense of hope for the future.  

In contrast, PRC is not short of (failed) social movement attempts, but most of time the internal and external pressures are in short. Many people do want a democratic society (as socialism feels like an illusion), but the current (economic) situation is just tolerable to avoid sacrifice. 

Under censorship, we volunteer to be blind, deaf, and silent. In reading Han Kang's book, she wrote that people died in 1980s' movements are remembered as "given their lives for others", though they likely never intended to become "sacrifices". Democratization is a complex and unpredictable process. And gradual political reforms doubtlessly take even longer time.
